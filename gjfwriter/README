This program writes Gaussian .gjf files from molecule names.

positional arguments:
  name                  The name of the molecule to create.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i [list_file [list_file ...]]
                        A file with a listing of molecules to make.
  -f folder             A folder to output the files.
  -n N                  The length of the chain. (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
  -x X                  The amount of molecules to stack on the x axis.
  -y Y                  The amount of molecules to stack on the y axis.
  -z Z                  The amount of molecules to stack on the z axis.
  -b BASIS              The basis functional to use for the calculation.
                        (b3lyp/6-31g(d) by default)
  -m MEM                The amount of memory to use for the calculation. (59GB
                        by default)
  -d D                  Used to scale an output image. (0 by default, meaning
                        no picture)
  -T                    Toggles to use the TDDFT method.
  -E                    Toggles showing error messages.
  -V                    Toggles showing all messages.
  -L                    Toggles showing the long name.





Note: This is case sensitive.
Note: Be sure to check the gjf files. Some errors might go unnoticed.

Examples:

gifwriter 24a_TON_24a_24a
// This will write the file "24a_TON_24a_24a_DFT.gjf" with that respective molecule in the current folder.

gifwriter 24a_TON_24a_24a -z 3
// This will write the file "24a_TON_24a_24a_m3_DFT.gjf" with that respective molecule in the current folder.

gifwriter 24a_TON_24a_24a 24b_TON_24a_24b -E
// This will write the files "24a_TON_24a_24a_DFT.gjf" and "24b_TON_24a_24b_DFT.gjf" with that respective molecule in the current folder. This will also show the errors.

gifwriter -i list.txt -z 2
// This will read each line from the file "list.txt" and run it with the setting -z 2. Meaning, the molecule will be stacked 2 high.

gifwriter -i list.txt -f molecules
// This will read each line from the file "list.txt" and save the output in the folder "molecules" if the folder exists.

gifwriter 24a_TON_24a_24a -m 100GB
// This will write the file "24a_TON_24a_24a_DFT.gjf" and set it to use 100GB of memory.

gifwriter 24a_TON_24a_24a -b someotherbasis
// This will write the file "24a_TON_24a_24a_someotherbasis_DFT.gjf" and set it to use 100GB of memory.

gifwriter 24a_TON_24a_24a -T
// This will write the file "24a_TON_24a_24a_TDDFT.gjf" with that respective molecule in the current folder.

gifwriter 24a_TON_24a_24a -d 20
// This will write the file "24a_TON_24a_24a_TDDFT.gjf" with that respective molecule in the current folder. Also, it will create a basic image of the resulting molecule with a per pixel scaling of 20.


Bugs
j(phenyl) and k(TMS) as R groups do not work. Reason: The extension of the ~ and the R group placement is ambiguous. Can be fixed with rewrite of connection code.

10(DTP) does not work. Reason: The double digits create problems for parsing. Can be fixed by adding case for "10"

Long limit chains are not implemented. Reason: the ending ~ bonds are ambiguous.

Images get chopped off. Reason: too lazy to add another conversion factor.

Non planar parts are skewed. Reason: the rotation is only 2D.

Image import error. Reason: PyInstaller does not ply well with PIL
